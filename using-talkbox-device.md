# Using TalkBox Device

## Setting up the Device

You can use either a TalkBox device or the TakBox simulator to see how your device will operate. To set up, follow the appropriate directions below:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="TalkBox Device" %}
The TalkBox device already comes with a TBC file specifying its number of buttons and audio sets. So all you need to do is connect to your computer!
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Simulator" %}
1. On the TCB app, go to `View > Launch Simulator`
2. On the Simulator, you can either open an existing TBC file or create a new one
3. If you create a new TBC file, the Set Up Wizard will guide you to customize the number of buttons and audio sets
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Using TalkBox

Once your TalkBox is set up, it's simple to use. Simply click on any of the assigned audio buttons to play the audio, or click on a swap button to go to the next audio set
